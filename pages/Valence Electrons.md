# Valence Electrons
- Valence electrons are the outermost shell of electrons of an atom
- The octet rule--atoms try to reach 8 electrons in their valence shell in order to become stable
	- The only exception to this rule is Hydrogen, whose valence shell gets filled with two electrons
- Valence electrons play an important role in [[Chemical Bonds]] and [[Chemical Reactions]]
