# Ions
- Atoms can only have a net neutral charge, so any "atom" that isn't netrual is considered an ion
### Cations
	- ==Ions with a positive net charge== (there are less electrons than protons), are called **cations**
	- Cations have a smaller radius than their neutral atom

	### Anions
	- ==Ions with a negative net charge== (there are more electrons than protons), are called **anions**
	- Anions have a larger radius than their neutral atom
