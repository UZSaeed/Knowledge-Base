- Lewis symbols are diagrams that represent the [[Valence Electrons]] of an atom
	- The electrons are represented by dots surrounding the atomic symbol of the element

- In order to make a Lewis Diagram:
	- Find the number of [[Valence Electrons]] using the periodic table
	- Write the atomic symbol of the element
	- Place the dots (corresponding to the number of electrons) around the atomic symbol-one at a time, and do this in one direction
